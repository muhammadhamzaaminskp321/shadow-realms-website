    <h2>üî• About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      In a world where magical realms collide and ancient curses rise, many fantasy RPGs focus too much on either combat or story. <strong>Shadow Realms: Rise of the Forgotten</strong> brings balance to both, offering an immersive experience where players can explore a deep narrative, enjoy rich lore, and engage in dynamic combat. Set in an open world, your choices truly matter, allowing you to shape your own destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Forgotten One, a resurrected warrior, you'll journey through cursed ruins, form alliances or enemies, and alter the fate of the Shadow Realm. The game provides freedom of choice, complex character builds, and a branching storyline that responds to your decisions.

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Game development is never without its challenges. Potential risks include delays or technical issues with new features. However, our team has extensive experience in Unity 3D, open-world design, and modding tools, and we've already developed a playable alpha demo with core mechanics in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main challenge is ensuring a smooth balance between narrative complexity and combat mechanics. Early-access playtests are ongoing to address these challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We promise transparent, monthly updates throughout development.
